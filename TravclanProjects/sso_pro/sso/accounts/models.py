    Note: Django-admin user and app user not split in different tables because of simplicity of development.
    Some libraries assume there is only one user model, and they can't work with both.
    For example to have a history log of changes for entities - to save which user made a change of object attribute,
    perhaps, auth-related libs, and some other.
    With current implementation we don't need to fork, adapt and maintain third party packages.
